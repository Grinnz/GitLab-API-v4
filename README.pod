=head1 NAME

GitLab::API::v3 - A complete GitLab API v3 client.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use GitLab::API::v3;
    
    my $api = GitLab::API::v3->new(
        url   => $v3_api_url,
        token => $token,
    );
    
    my $branches = $api->branches( $project_id );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a one-to-one interface with the GitLab
API v3.  Much is not documented here as it would just be duplicating
GitLab's own L<API Documentation|http://doc.gitlab.com/ce/api/README.html>.

=head1 CONSTANTS

Several values in the GitLab API require looking up the numeric value
for a meaning (such as C<access_level> and C<visibility_level>).
Instead of doing that, you can use L<GitLab::API::v3::Constants>.

=head1 EXCEPTIONS

The API methods will all throw (hopefully) a useful exception if
an unsuccessful response is received from the API.  That is except for
C<GET> requests that return a C<404> response - these will return C<undef>
for methods that return a value.

If you'd like to catch and handle these exceptions consider using
L<Try::Tiny>.

=head1 LOGGING

This module uses L<Log::Any> and produces some debug messages here
and there, but the most useful bits are the info messages produced
just before each API call.

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

=head2 url

The URL to your v3 API endpoint.  Typically this will be something
like C<http://git.example.com/api/v3>.

=head2 token

A GitLab API token.

=head1 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

=head2 rest_client

An instance of L<GitLab::API::v3::RESTClient>.  Typically you will not
be setting this as it defaults to a new instance and customization
should not be necessary.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Net::GitLab> purports to provide an interface to the GitLab API, but
it is hard to tell due to a complete lack of documentation via either
POD or unit tests.

=head1 CONTRIBUTING

This module is auto-generated from a set of YAML files defining the
interface of GitLab's API.  If you'd like to contribute to this module
then please feel free to make a
L<fork on GitHub|https://github.com/bluefeet/GitLab-API-v3>
and submit a pull request, just make sure you edit the files in the
C<authors/> directory instead of C<lib/GitLab/API/v3.pm> directly.

Please see
